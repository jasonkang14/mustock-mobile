## SIDE PROJECT with Friends, trying to build a system which an algorithm trades stocks.
Built with Next.js because we are planning on launching this as a business but did not succeed because the algorithm was not so successful in making profits

Therefore not deployed

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
